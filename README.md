# Preemptive multi-threaded kernel for the 8086 processor

This simple kernel runs a single user application with "userMain" as its entrypoint. The kernel supports threads, semaphores, events and signals (as defined in the appropriate header files). Written for an Operating Systems class. 

Compiles with BCC (memory model: huge).
